## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create a new scene
Start by creating a new scene using the **Decentraland Creator Hub** (use the `Empty Scene` template).

### 2. Install Team Hub
Inside your scene folder, install the library:

```bash
npm install @dcl-regenesislabs/teamhub-lib@latest
```

### 3. Copy assets
Copy the required 3D models and images to your project:

```bash
node node_modules/@dcl-regenesislabs/teamhub-lib/scripts/copy-assets.cjs
```

This copies all assets (models, textures, etc.) to your `assets/` folder.

### 4. Add to your scene
In your `src/index.ts`, import and initialize Team Hub:

```ts
import { TeamHub } from '@dcl-regenesislabs/teamhub-lib'

export function main(): void {
  const hub = new TeamHub()
}
```

That's it! Your scene now includes all Team Hub features.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Assets not showing up
If 3D models or images aren't visible, manually run the asset copy script:

```bash
node node_modules/@dcl-regenesislabs/teamhub-lib/scripts/copy-assets.cjs
```

### UI not appearing
Make sure you've called `new TeamHub()` in your `main()` function.

### Build errors
Ensure you're using compatible versions:
- Decentraland SDK 7.x (latest)
- Node.js >= 18.0.0

Try updating the SDK:
```bash
